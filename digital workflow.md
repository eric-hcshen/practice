[4 Steps to Migrating Your Business to a Digital Workflow] (https://www.processmaker.com/blog/4-steps-to-migrating-your-business-to-a-digital-workflow/)
- Step 1: Perform a workflow audit of existing structures
The workflow requires manual data entry.
The workflow is repetitive.
The workflow needs signatures or approval from multiple departments.
The workflow must be shared and updated between a large number of people.
The workflow calls for assistance from remote or off-site staff.
The workflow involves manual computations.
The workflow is often completed incorrectly due to human error.
The workflow and its many stages are difficult to track, replicate or report progress on.
- Step 2: Start with one digital workflow
chat channels like Slack, which are known for their ability to integrate with a number of other digital business tools, are another tool businesses should equip to streamline their digital workflows. Emails are time-consuming and do not easily facilitate conversations between more than two people. 
- Step 3: Integrate communication tools
For notification, colloboration and information
- Step 4: Optimize, automate and expand digital workflows
After automating, you should examine how individual responsibilities have changed or shifted and set new expectations that better align with your new digital system.

## What is Workflow Engine
Benefits of a Workflow Engine
A workflow engine offers organizations many benefits, including:

Increased efficiency. Automating time-consuming tasks frees employees up to focus on their core activities.
Increased accountability. Employees can see what they are supposed to be doing and when important deadlines must be met. This also serves to boost job satisfaction.
Increased transparency. Both employees and management can see all activities and who is responsible for completing each task.
Improved compliance. A workflow engine helps organizations maintain audit trails to improve compliance.

### Typical Use Cases
Workflow engines are capable of streamlining many business processes. The following are two examples of common use cases for a workflow engine.

- Employee Onboarding
According to research by Glassdoor, a smooth employee onboarding process can improve new hire retention by 82% and productivity by more than 70%. Many organizations continue to rely on manual employee onboarding processes, resulting in a fragmented and frustrating employee experience. With a workflow engine, an organization can ensure that each onboarding task is carried out smoothly.

For example, the first task in the onboarding process may be to prepare paperwork for a new hire. Once the responsible HR employee indicates that paperwork is completed, the workflow engine can automatically notify the IT department to grant computer access. This way, no steps are missed, and the employee has everything that he or she needs to get started.

- Approval Processes
Manual approval processes result in significant direct, indirect, and hidden costs. For example, according to data from the Center for Advanced Procurement Strategy (CAPS), the average cost per purchase order ranges between $50 and $1,000 depending on the industry and vertical.

With a workflow engine, organizations can automate approval processes saving both time and money. For instance, when an employee submits a purchase request, the request is automatically routed to a supervisor for approval. Once signed, the approval is routed back to the employee. The employee can easily track the status of the request rather than spending time tracking down the supervisor for a signature.
